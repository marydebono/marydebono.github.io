  <p>
	Dr. Debono has been one of the most patient, caring and intelligent health care providers that we've come across.
	 We went from feeling frustrated and not knowing who could help us with my son's reflux/tongue tie & tense body symptoms to finding
	 Dr. Mary Debono who has helped us understand everything that was going on. She provided us with a holistic approach to try for a few weeks, 
	looking at different aspects affecting my son while using different types of therapy to ensure he was in the right place so that if necessary
	 a tongue tie release would be as effective as possible. She took the time to make sure all of our questions were answered, that we were
	 comfortable and to reassure us that things were going in the right direction.
	 She is very knowledgeable in her field of work and I would highly recommend her. Thank you Dr. Debono!  </p>
