      <h2>About Me</h2>

      <p>I’m Dr. Mary Debono, DDS, and I’m passionate about providing care to infants experiencing feeding difficulties. I completed both my undergraduate degree (2018) and Doctor of Dental Surgery (2022) at the University of Toronto, followed by a 1 year general practice residency at <a href="https://atriumhealth.org/locations/detail/carolinas-medical-center" target = "blank">Carolinas Medical Center</a> in North Carolina.</p><br>

      <p>I have a special focus on assessing and treating infant tongue and lip ties, helping families support their baby’s feeding, comfort, and early oral development. I take a conservative and multidisciplinary approach to tongue tie therapy and review treatment options including, <b>but not limited to</b>, tongue tie release surgery.</p><br>

      <p>I collaborate with feeding therapists (international board certified lactation consultants (IBCLC) and speech language pathologists (SLP)) and bodyworkers (physiotherapist, osteopath, craniosacral therapists and chiropractors) to best understand and address your baby’s needs.</p><br>

      <p>I work to understand your goals and to educate and empower you to make treatment decisions that best suit your family. I aim to make the experience reassuring and collaborative — helping families understand the process, address any concerns, and set their little ones up for healthy growth from the very beginning.</p><br>

      <p>If chestfeeding is painful or your baby has a shallow latch, reflux symptoms, clicking noises while feeding, insufficient milk transfer, slow weight gain, milk dribbling out of the mouth during feeds, fussiness or frustration with feeding, or any other feeding symptoms, please reach out!</p>
