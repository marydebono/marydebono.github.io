      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I’m Dr. Mary Debono, DDS, and I’m passionate about providing personalized, comprehensive dental care for patients of all ages.
 I completed both my undergraduate degree (2018) and Doctor of Dental Surgery (2022) at the University of Toronto, followed by a 1 year general practice residency at Carolinas Medical Center in North Carolina.</p><br>

      <p>I have a special focus on assessing and treating infant tongue and lip ties, helping families support their babies’ feeding, comfort, and early oral development. 
I take a multidisciplinary approach to tongue tie therapy and review treatment options including, <b>but not limited to</b>, tongue tie release surgery. 
</p> <br>
I take an individualized approach to understand your goals and to educate and empower you to make treatment decisions that best suit your family. I aim to make the experience reassuring and collaborative - helping families understand the process, address any concerns, and set their little ones up for healthy growth from the very beginning.
